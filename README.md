## Overview of Project

- The purpose of this project was to determine how different theater campaigns performed in relation to their respective launch dates and funding goals using our previously manipulated Kickstarter dataset.

## Analysis and Challenges

- Outcomes Based on Launch Date Analysis:
  - Analysis Description: *This analysis depicts the number of theater campaign outcomes [successful, failed, and canceled] by month for every year the campaign was launched.  Please also note that a filter has also been added to this data set, in order to provide you with further insights into the specific yearly theater campaign outcomes.*
  
  - Challenges Enountered: *One of the challenges I encountered while perfoming this analysis was in being able to 'sort' the outcome rows in a way that presented the 'Successful' outcome findings first.  I overcame this challenge by researching the most efficient way to 'sort' pivot table data, and found that by sorting the outcomes from 'Z-A' I was able to achieve my objective.*

- Outcomes Based on Goals Analysis:
  - Analysis Description: *This analysis details the outcome percentage for all successful, failed and canceled plays based upon the respective funding goal amount.*
  
  - Challenges Enountered: *One of the challenges I encountered while performing this analysis was with the axis labels on the line chart.  I noticed that the axis labels of 'Series 1, Series 2, & Series 3' were inaccurate descriptions of the outcomes that the chart was presenting.  In order to rectify this issue, I right-clicked on the chart and pressed 'Select Data' to ensure that I had captured the Row Headers of my dataset when Inserting the Line Chart onto the excel sheet.  As expected I saw that I had forgotten to select the first row, and selected the data to include the headers in the first row which fixed my problem!*

## Results

- Outcomes Based on Launch Date Analysis:
 - Analysis Outcome: *Between the years of 2009 - 2016 the most successful Theater Camapigns were successfully launched in the months of May & June; the most canceled theater campaigns were launched in the month of January; and the most failed campaigns were launched in the months of May & July/October.*
 
- Outcomes Based on Goals Analysis:
  - Analysis Outcome: *Based upon the 534 plays that had a funding amount goal of $1,000 to $4,999, 73% of the plays were successful and 27% of the plays failed.*
